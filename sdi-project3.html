<p>For this assignment I decided to make my story about one of my favorite things to do, which is travel. I have been
    to many countries, and I look forward to visiting many more. I have been to all of the countries included in this story. 
    Everyone should visit another country, at least once. It instantly chances your perspective on many things.
